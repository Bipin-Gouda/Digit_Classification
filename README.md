Handwritten Digit Classification using TensorFlow and Python. Tried building a simple neural network with only the input and output layer after that have added a Hidden layer to check the difference in performance. (Following a YT tutorial)

NOTE(for self) : Try Implementing CNN as it is an Img data and compare CNN , ANN performance
